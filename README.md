LCP1769_blank
=============

Forked from [alvarop/arm-gcc-barebones](https://github.com/alvarop/arm-gcc-barebones).

Nothing really changed, I need to take a look at SystemCoreClock to check if it is set right for LCP1769...

I added clangd config file and the flash command using openocd to flash the chip.

NOTES:

* I used the pre-compiled arm-gcc from https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
* Initial autogenerated makefile and most support files came from http://mbed.org/
* startup_LPC17xx.c came from code examples in http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m3/LPC1768FBD100.html#documentation
